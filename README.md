# Python Snake Game

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, built using Python and the Pygame library. The player controls a snake, guiding it to eat food while avoiding collision with the game area boundaries or itself. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length. The objective is to grow as long as possible without colliding.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Installing Python
Download and install the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Pygame
After installing Python, run the following command to install Pygame:
pip install pygame


## Running the Game
To play the game, clone this repository or download the source code. Navigate to the folder containing the game files and run the following command:
python snake_game.py

Replace `snake_game.py` with the actual name of the Python script.

## Gameplay
- Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to control the movement of the snake.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundary of the game window.
- The score is based on the amount of food the snake eats.
